### What is a Vision - Our definition. üîç

A Vision is a future condition that seems nearly impossible at the moment to achieve. We have identified that a Vision is structured into three parts: material, emotions, and values.

- First, _material_ includes things like money, a house or a car.
- Second, _emotions_ encompass feelings like a future family, love, friends, and other motivating factors that keep you going.
- Third, _values_ represent principles that guide your actions when faced with events.

For us, a Vision is the combination of material things, emotions, and values‚Äîa holistic approach that not only enhances personal growth but also facilitates the attainment of material goals.

### How to formulate a strong ten year Vision. üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Given the three-part definition, we utilize these elements to formulate our Vision. It is beneficial to brainstorm before attempting to articulate the ten-year Vision. Consider these three questions:

- What _material_ things do I dream of? Are they genuine desires or influenced by external sources?
- What _emotions_ can anchor these material things? Who or what motivates me?
- What _values_ do I stand for? Is it wisdom, love, freedom, courage, stability, or something else?

Answering these questions should facilitate the creation of a robust ten-year vision, which is foundational as all subsequent visions depend on it.
Let's formulate an example vision.

- _Material_: A Porsche, multiple houses in Germany, Spain, Austria, and Switzerland, $5,000,000 in the bank.
- _Emotions_: I aspire to be the best father for my future family.
- _Values_: My guiding principles are wisdom, love, and freedom.

Now, let's bring it all in one Vision together:

_In ten years, I will possess a Porsche, multiple houses in Germany, Spain, Austria, and Switzerland, and $5,000,000 in the bank.
Beyond material acquisitions, my goal is to be the best father for my future family, driving me towards achieving these material goals and fostering personal growth.
My values on this journey are wisdom, love, and freedom. Regardless of what challenges arise, I will stay true to these principles._

This is an example of a ten-year vision. If you encounter difficulties in formulating your vision, consider using an open ChatBot and sharing the three parts for assistance.
Also include our example Vision that the output is better.

### How to build five visions that depend on each other üåü

The image (Image 2) illustrates the steps to build five visions that depend on each other.
We have included "Skills" in the two and one-year visions, recognizing its significance, particularly in the initial stages of the process.

Once the ten-year vision is established, it's time to lay the foundation for the five-year vision, which relies on the framework set by the ten-year vision.

**The five-year vision brainstorming:**

- _Material_: Leasing a Porsche, owning houses in Germany and Austria, and having $2,000,000 in the bank.
- _Emotions_: Focused on providing for my loved ones and extending assistance to those in need.
- _Values_: Upholding wisdom, love, and freedom as guiding principles.

Bringing it all together:

_In five years, I will lease a Porsche, own houses in Germany and Austria, and have $2,000,000 in the bank. Beyond material wealth, I aim to understand and navigate my emotions and fears, striving to become the best version of myself while embracing constant growth. My journey will be guided by wisdom, love, and freedom, and I remain committed to these principles regardless of the challenges I face._

**The three-year brainstorming:**

- _Material_: Investing $500,000 in various income streams.
- _Emotions_: Focused on personal growth and fulfillment.
- _Values_: Upholding wisdom, love, and freedom.

Bring it all together:

_In three years, I will have invested $500,000 in various income streams. Emotionally, I will focus on personal growth and fulfillment, guided by the principles of wisdom, love, and freedom._

**The two-year brainstorming:**

The two-year vision shifts focus to skill acquisition, setting the stage for higher aspirations.

- _Material_: Minimal material possessions.
- _Skills_: Mastery in marketing, sales, coding at an advanced level, with a priority on negotiation skills.
- _Emotions_: Self-fulfillment.
- _Values_: Upholding wisdom, love, and freedom.

Bring it all together:

_In two years, I will possess minimal material possessions, having prioritized mastery in marketing, sales, coding at an advanced level, with a particular emphasis on negotiation skills. Emotionally, I will find fulfillment in my pursuits, guided by the principles of wisdom, love, and freedom._

Note: As our vision aligns, achieving greater goals may require temporary imbalance in life, work, and family responsibilities, which isn't necessarily negative.

**The one-year brainstorming:**

- _Material_: Fewer material possessions.
- _Skills_: Proficiency in coding, marketing, and negotiation.
- _Emotions_: Focused on personal satisfaction and well-being.
- _Values_: Upholding wisdom, love, and freedom.

Bring it all together:

_In one year, I will have achieved proficiency in coding, marketing, and negotiation, while maintaining fewer material possessions. Emotionally, I will prioritize personal satisfaction and well-being, guided by the principles of wisdom, love, and freedom._

Following this, focus on short-term goals [(goal blog)](https://goalkeepr.io/en/docs/goal) to realize the one-year vision.

### What are the differences between a Vision and a Goal? üéØ

The differences between a Vision and a Goal lie in our definition. Goals, in our context, concentrate solely on _material_ things or _objectives_. Additionally, goals are oriented towards the short term and elicit satisfaction upon their accomplishment.
On the other hand, a Vision incorporates this satisfaction but is designed to instill a sense of peace in your life. This tranquility arises from the understanding that the realization of short-term goals is the pathway to ultimately achieving your Vision one day.

### Why are five Visions enough? üåü

Indeed, the dynamics of goals are such that an excess can lead to a cessation of momentum.
The overwhelming number of goals can either become burdens or result in an excessive dopamine output.

Limiting the scope to five Visions is a strategic choice.
This breakdown into specific time frames‚ÄîTen-year Vision, Five-year Vision, Three-year Vision, Two-year Vision, and One-year Vision‚Äîserves as a structured framework.
It encourages a shift in focus from planning to execution. By concentrating on the execution phase, you enhance the likelihood of making tangible progress toward each Vision without succumbing to the potential pitfalls of excessive goal-setting.
