### What is a Task - Our definition. 🔍

A task is something realy concrete that is achievable by doing it right now.
A task is something you already have the knowledge to perform to get an output.
We categorize tasks into two different Categories:

1. Simple tasks that can be executed in maximum of five minutes
2. Hard tasks that need definetly more time to execute

The simple tasks are the entry tasks.
These should enable you to start working and get fast results on the goal due to the low time cost.
The hard tasks are followed after the easy tasks - because when you start working on the simple the likelihood that you work on the harder tasks are greater.
