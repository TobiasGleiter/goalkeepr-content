### What is a Goal - Our definition üêê

A goal is a specific, measurable skill aimed at achieving a concrete outcome by targeting specific objectives.
It always focuses on a greater vision and represents a step towards that vision.
Small goals are preferable because they are more achievable.
Large goals should be avoided because the probability of achieving them decreases as their size increases.

### How to formulate a strong Goal üèóÔ∏è

The goal you formulate focuses on the latest vision.
When you currently started you create a goal that brings you one step towards your one year vision.
Your goal should be concrete, small and relatively fast to achieve.
Many goals will form later your vision. Your goal should use the SMART formula.
Let's break this down and brainstorm by showing an example.
First let's remember the Vision we work on:
_In one year, I will have achieved proficiency in coding, marketing, and negotiation, while maintaining fewer material possessions.
Emotionally, I will prioritize personal satisfaction and well-being, guided by the principles of wisdom, love, and freedom._

It's clear that the skills in the vision focus on coding, marketing, and negotiation. We pick "coding" and form a specific goal.
Let's see how this looks with the SMART formula:

- Specific: Create a landing page using Next.js with a hero, why, and what section that uses internationalization.
- Measurable: Implement two languages: "German" and "English"; Three sections: "hero", "why", and "what".
- Achievable: Possible due to the fact that I am already familiar with Next.js.
- Relevant: Related to one year Vision.
- Time-based: Finish this until +30 days (use a real date!)

Note: Just start writing and refine it as detailed as necessary.

Therefore, we can form out of the points a sentence that is our goal:

_I will create a landing page using Next.js with three sections ("hero", "why", "what") within the next 30 days. The landing page will be implemented in at least two languages, "German" and "English"._

Here's the corrected text:

### Why only one Goal at a time? üèÖ

Adopting a 'One Goal at a Time' mindset is a game-changer.
While it's tempting to set multiple goals, doing so may lead to a loss of interest in all of them.
The true challenge lies in focusing on one goal at a time, persisting in its pursuit even when faced with challenges or inconveniences.
When you commit to a goal, it becomes essential to achieve it, reinforcing the idea that your goals are of utmost importance, or acknowledging if a goal no longer aligns with your priorities.
