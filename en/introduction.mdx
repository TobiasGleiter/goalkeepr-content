### Why it matters ðŸ’¥

We believe that setting visions that build upon each other and continuously working towards a goal that brings you closer to your vision significantly advances your personal development. Even though we all often understand how important this is, fulfilling our goals is difficult, especially when it becomes challenging to stick to them. That's why we've developed a system to help you keep your future (vision) in sight and actively work towards it.

### What you will learn ðŸ“š

Currently two things:

- Everything about [visions](https://goalkeepr.io/docs/visions)
- Everything about [goals](https://goalkeepr.io/docs/goal)
- Everything about [tasks](https://goalkeepr.io/docs/tasks) (or todos)

### Your own strategy...

The best way is to build a strategy through visions by defining at least 5 visions that guide your future direction. A vision is much more than a goal; it's your future. Therefore, it makes sense to invest a lot of time in the vision. To try to find out who you want to be and what defines you. It makes sense to draw on the experiences of others, as well as books.

We have defined a strategy for ourselves based on the visions, which looks like this:

There are at least five visions, with the longest vision at least 10 years away. For us, a vision is a combination of material success, emotional connections, and your own values. This definition, we believe, leads you to a better self. All visions (we recommend five) are built step by step with individual, small goals. Goals are achieved through even smaller tasks (or todos).

### Where to start? ðŸš€

1. Start by developing your [five visions](https://goalkeepr.io/docs/visions). Take your time, but write everything down. You can always change it later.
2. Then formulate [a goal](https://goalkeepr.io/docs/goal) that brings you closer to your next vision.
3. Create small [tasks (or todos)](https://goalkeepr.io/docs/tasks) to achieve your goal within a week.
