## Welcome to Goalkeepr ðŸ”“ðŸ”‘

_Last updated: February 11, 2024_

### Why it is important ðŸ’¥

We believe that setting visions that build on each other and continuously working towards a goal that brings you closer to your vision significantly advances your personal development. Even though we all often understand how important this is, it's difficult to fulfill our goals, especially when it becomes challenging to stick to them. That's why we've developed a system to help you keep your future (vision) in sight and actively work towards it.

### What you will learn ðŸ“š

At the moment, two things:

- All about [Visions](https://goalkeepr.io/en/docs/visions): what they are and how to set them.
- All about [Goals](https://goalkeepr.io/en/docs/goal).
- All about [Tasks](https://goalkeepr.io/en/docs/tasks): they are a part of a goal.

### What the strategy looks like...

The best way is to build a strategy through visions by defining at least 5 Visions that set your future directions. A Vision is different from a goal. We have identified that a Vision is structured into three parts: material, emotions, and values.

Overall, our suggested strategy looks like this:

All Visions are built with goals, step by step. Goals are built with tasks.

### Where to start? ðŸš€

Start by building your [Visions](https://goalkeepr.io/en/docs/visions), and after that, build your [Goals](https://goalkeepr.io/en/docs/goal).
